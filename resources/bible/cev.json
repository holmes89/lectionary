Your own son had to leave the country.

Absalom Was Handsome", "25": "No one in all Israel was as handsome and well-built as Absalom.", "26": "He got his hair cut once a year, and when the hair was weighed, it came to about five pounds.", "27": "Absalom had three sons. He also had a daughter named Tamar, who grew up to be very beautiful. Absalom Finally Sees David", "28": "Absalom lived in Jerusalem for two years without seeing his father.", "29": "He wanted Joab to talk to David for him. So one day he sent a message asking Joab to come over, but Joab refused. Absalom sent another message, but Joab still refused.", "30": "Finally, Absalom told his servants, \"Joab's barley field is right next to mine. Go set it on fire!\" And they did.", "31": "Joab went to Absalom's house and demanded, \"Why did your servants set my field on fire?\"", "32": "Absalom answered, \"You didn't pay any attention when I sent for you. I want you to ask my father why he told me to come back from Geshur. I was better off there. I want to see my father now!

I would be fair to everyone.\"", "5": "Whenever anyone would come to Absalom and start bowing down, he would reach out and hug and kiss them.", "6": "That's how he treated everyone from Israel who brought a complaint to the king. Soon everyone in Israel liked Absalom better than they liked David.", "7": "Four years later, Absalom said to David, \"Please, let me go to Hebron.

You don't have to leave with us. Go back and join the new king!", "20": "You haven't been with me very long, so why should you have to follow me, when I don't even know where I'm going?

Right now they are as fierce as a mother bear whose cubs have just been killed. Besides, your father has a lot of experience in fighting wars, and he won't be spending the night with the others.", "9": "He has probably already found a hiding place in a cave or somewhere else.

I saw that the brightness of the LORD's glory had filled the temple, and I immediately bowed with my face to the ground.", "5": "The LORD said: Ezekiel, son of man, I am going to give you the laws for my temple. So pay attention and listen carefully to what kind of people are allowed to come in the temple, and what kind are not.", "6": "Tell those rebellious people of Israel: I, the LORD God, command you to stop your evil ways!", "7": "My temple has been disgraced, because you have let godless, stubborn foreigners come here when sacrifices are being offered to me.

Rules for PriestsThe LORD said:", "15": "The priests of the Levi tribe who are descendants of Zadok the priest were faithful to me, even when the rest of the Israelites turned away.
